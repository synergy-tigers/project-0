                 Create an About Me site page. The page should have 3 parts:
                 1. A paragraph about you.
                 2. A list of hobbies or favorite things.
                 3. An image of your choosing.
                After each part, you should upload your progress to your GitHub repo on a working branch.
                After all parts have been completed, merge your working branch to your main branch.
